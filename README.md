## Bugs and Fixes

* Images not found when deployed to heroku
    * because some styles sheets and images definitions in the template were not in block tags
    * Also added {% load static %} to all templates due to block end error 
* Styling and images not found when deployed
    * installed whitenoise package
* Fixed variable EMAIL_USE_TLS, was incorrect as EMAIL_USES_TLS (Thanks Ian Meigh for spotting it for me - post in Slack)
    * After hours of figuring out how "it" works, then going through error after error, the brain swells and the simplest typo is blocked from your sight
