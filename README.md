## Testing

# Django Tests

* Created test cases to test the BookingForm. Test file name: test_bookingform.py
    * Tests to confirm that the form is only valid if all required fields are completed
    * Tests to confirm that only the necessary field are displayed on the form
* Created test cases to test the ContactForm. Test file name: test_contactform.py
    * Tests are run to confirm that the form is only valid if all required fields are completed
    * Tests to confirm that only the necessary field are displayed on the form
    * Not tested: Confirm field is read-only/disabled.



## Bugs and Fixes

* Images not found when deployed to heroku
    * because some styles sheets and images definitions in the template were not in block tags
    * Also added {% load static %} to all templates due to block end error 
* Styling and images not found when deployed
    * installed whitenoise package
* Fixed variable EMAIL_USE_TLS, was incorrect as EMAIL_USES_TLS (Thanks Ian Meigh for spotting it for me - post in Slack)
    * After hours of figuring out how "it" works, then going through error after error, the brain swells and the simplest typo is blocked from your sight
* BookingAdmin class -- confirm functions -- admin.py
    * previously working (somehow) with two parameters, ```def confirm_booking(self, queryset):```, when simply changing confirm from 0 to 1 and vice versa. 0 being No and 1 being Yes.
    * after changing the field type from integer to char and adding an additional option of 'cancel' I received this error:
        * confirm_booking() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
    * After scouring the web for possible causes I came up empty handed. I decided to look deeper into the detail and found my solution from looking into:
        * File "/workspace/.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/options.py", line 1408, in response_action response = func(self, request, queryset)
    * Adding 'request' as a second parameter solved the issue: ```def confirm_booking(self, request, queryset):```
* Booking template
    * after changing confirm field from integer to char in booking model I didn't remove the conditional statement from the booking template used to set confirm 0 to No and 1 to Yes. This displayed inconsistant values.
