### Design

* Wireframes for the project can be seen [here](/static/design/herbs_restaurant.pdf)


## Testing

### Django Tests

* Created test cases to test the BookingForm. Test file name: test_bookingform.py
    * Tests to confirm that the form is only valid if all required fields are completed
    * Tests to confirm that only the necessary field are displayed on the form
* Created test cases to test the ContactForm. Test file name: test_contactform.py
    * Tests are run to confirm that the form is only valid if all required fields are completed
    * Tests to confirm that only the necessary field are displayed on the form
    * Not tested: Confirm field is read-only/disabled.
* Created test cases to test that all view templates render
* Created test case to test that adding a contact or submitting a contact form works as expected
* Created test cases to verify that the user can:
    * Create a booking
    * Update/make changes to a booking
    * Delete a booking
    * Mark a booking as cancelled

### Manual Testing

* Tested the Home, Menu, About pages. These all work as expected.
* Tested that a user can make a booking
    * An email is sent to the restaurant admin advising of the new booking
    * The booking is listed on the user's booking listing
    * for each line item a **'Change'** and **'Cancel'** button is activated
* Tested that a user can change booking details
    * once a change is made to booking, if the booking had already been confirmed by restaurant admin, the status of the booking will be reset from **confirm='Yes'** to **confirm='No'**
* Tested that the user can delete a record
    * Delete option/button was replaced by the cancel button
    * On deleting a booking an email is sent to the restaurant admin
* Tested that the user can cancel a booking
    * When a user cancels a booking **confirm** is set to **'Cancel'**
    * The option to cancel a booking is preferable, as the record will still be visible to the admin
    * Once the user cancels the booking, the booking is no longer displayed to the user
    * On cancelling a booking an email is sent to the restaurant admin
    * Functionality can be added later to provide conditions permitting a user to delete a booking
* Tested viewing the OPEN TABLES VIEW.
    * Only open tables are displayed
* Tested the contact form
    * An email is sent to the admin with the content of the content form
    * The contact table is updated with the content of the content form
* Login/Sign up works as expected.
    * New users will receive and email to validate their account

## Bugs and Fixes

### Resolved
* Images not found when deployed to heroku
    * because some styles sheets and images definitions in the template were not in block tags
    * Also added ```{% load static %}``` to all templates due to block end error 
* Styling and images not found when deployed
    * installed whitenoise package
* Fixed variable EMAIL_USE_TLS, was incorrect as EMAIL_USES_TLS (Thanks Ian Meigh for spotting it for me - post in Slack)
    * After hours of figuring out how "it" works, then going through error after error, the brain swells and the simplest typo is blocked from your sight
* BookingAdmin class -- confirm functions -- admin.py
    * previously working (somehow) with two parameters, ```def confirm_booking(self, queryset):```, when simply changing confirm from 0 to 1 and vice versa. 0 being No and 1 being Yes.
    * after changing the field type from integer to char and adding an additional option of 'cancel' I received this error:
        * confirm_booking() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
    * After scouring the web for possible causes I came up empty handed. I decided to look deeper into the detail and found my solution from looking into:
        * File "/workspace/.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/options.py", line 1408, in response_action response = func(self, request, queryset)
    * Adding 'request' as a second parameter solved the issue: ```def confirm_booking(self, request, queryset):```
* Booking template
    * after changing confirm field from integer to char in booking model I didn't remove the conditional statement from the booking template used to set confirm 0 to No and 1 to Yes. This displayed inconsistent values.
* TimeInput - when updating a booking the time was not pulled into the form
    * Cause: the format on the booking_time field was: ```format=('%h:%m')``` instead of ```format=('%H:%M')```
* User could add any table id to the booking form
    * Added checks to prevent booking for invalid table ids
* User could add bookings for past dates
    * Added checks to prevent users from adding bookings for past or current date. Only future bookings allowed.

### Unresolved
* created date is updating to current date on update of a record
